Title: Run R Scripts If Needed
Authors@R: c(person("Arni", "Magnusson", role=c("aut","cre"), email="thisisarni@gmail.com"))
Description: A simple make-like utility to run R scripts if needed, based on
  last modified time. Implemented in base R with no additional software
  requirements, organizational overhead or structural requirements. The make()
  function does the same thing as makefiles do: creates 'target' using 'prereq'
  files and a 'recipe'. In short, if any 'target' is either missing or is older
  than any 'prereq', then the R script is run.
